# BSV-php-captcha
A bare minimum skeleton framework to create a captcha button on a form using MoneyButton

We previously created a BSV MoneyButton based Captcha Plugin for the popular Joomla CMS. However, not everyone uses Joomla, and we had some feedback that they wanted to create the tool on their own website.
This skeleton framework will allow you to easily create your own captcha via Money Button. Edit the index.php file variables to link to your own moneybutton.
